# pong-performance

Project built for a Sonic Performance for the course Performance Project at the University of Glasgow.
The intended use of this unity application is to be used as an instrument by two performers.
The performers interface with the actions in the game thanks to OSC messages, which can then be used by another program like MAX MSP.

Unity Version: 2019.2.9
External Package: 
 * extOSC : open sound control communication
 * TextMeshPro : basic UI
 * Streaming Asset : build debugging
